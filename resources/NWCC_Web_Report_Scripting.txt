USDA NRCS National Water Climate Data Center - Instructions for scripting the downloading of NWCC data.

The first step to getting data is to search for the sites you are interested in by using the the SNOTEL/SCAN data inventory page -https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/inventory

You will be able to save a csv-formatted inventory file with this tool.

The scripts below will when work off of this csv-formatted inventory file.

The inventory file will contain the period of record start date if you need historic data.

The scripts included in these instructions will run in a Unix, Linux or MacOSx system as is. 

They would need to be modified to run on DOS.

The scripts use the 'curl' utility.  

The scripts can also use the 'wget' if the syntax is modified to something like this
wget \
-o wget.log \
--output-document=2136_SOIL.csv \ --post-data='intervalType=Current&report=SOIL&timeseries=Hourly&format=copy&sitenum=2136&interval=YEAR' \
https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/view

The default unit for temperatures in these scripts is Celcius.
If you want to retrieve temperatures in Farenheit, add the following
parameter to your scripts:
	&temp_unit=9

If you plan to run your scripts on a regular basis, we recommend that you append the following to your URLs so that we can notify you of impending changes or outages:

Using an inventory.csv file to construct a period of record pull of data
========================================================================
To get a list of SCAN stations with start and end years, use our inventory,
choosing 'SCAN' as the network and 'Download'.
        https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/inventory

Once you get the inventory you want, save it in csv format
You can parse this file (using awk if unix) to create a script
to get period of record script data for the files you need.
        station id
        start wateryear
        end wateryear
